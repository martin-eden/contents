* Lua

  There are three types of my Lua code assemblies.

  First is "workshop", it is my personal Lua framework. Mix of different
  design decisions in my Lua journey. Contains essential pieces for all
  projects I've done.

  Second is "released projects". They are self-contained solutions
  having in repository all the code they need and no dead code. Frozen
  in their time. They have "workshop" directory.

  Third is "unreleased projects". They are expected to use "workshop"
  of their time. Development may happen there or may not.

  * [Workshop](https://github.com/martin-eden/workshop)
    (2016-09 .. )

    Personal codebase for Lua projects.

    My Lua code hive. That's evolution, not design.

  * [Lua code formatter (lcf)](https://github.com/martin-eden/lua_code_formatter)
    (2016-08 .. 2017-01)

    Parses source text to AST, transforms AST, compiles back to source text.

    Still one of the best projects I ever made. Core is my grammar parser
    with two main modes (sequence and choice) and one flag (repeat). Like
    LPEG but different. Also invented and tried many design patters there.

    Satellite projects

    * [Lua table serializer](https://github.com/martin-eden/lua_table_serializer)
      (2017-05)

      Serialize Lua table to source code that recreates this table.

      Tables in Lua can contain cycles, so you can't serialize them to
      data format like JSON. Dealing with cycles was challenging
      challenge.

    * [Autoldoc](https://github.com/martin-eden/autoldoc)
      (2017-08)

      Automatically place LDoc comments in Lua source file.

      Mostly POC, I'm not using auto-documenters as a class of tools.
      Used AST from my code formatter to locate places where to insert
      documentation comments.

    * [Command-line generator for lcf](https://github.com/martin-eden/lcf_params_gui)
      (2018-07)

      GUI to generate Bash command line for Lua code formatter.

      Was playing with TekUI(Lua/C) library.

  * [DS3231 GUI](https://github.com/martin-eden/tekui_ds3231)
    (2019-12 .. 2020-01)

    Graphical interface to hardware real-time clock module DS3231.
    (Hardware host part is Firmata-compatible board.)

    I2C channel from Firmata (in Arduino) -- USB connection -- data
    parser/compiler in Lua -- representation of structured data in
    TekUI. Then data goes back. Was pleasant experience.

  * [Lightday](https://github.com/martin-eden/lightday)
    (2020-03)

    TekUI to calculate length of lightday. (Depending of latitude
    and day number.)

    Was going to use calculations to emulate sun for my tomatoes growbox
    but plain 16/8 worked better. And you will have troubles moving lamp
    in circle in growbox anyway.

  * [Firmata ambassador](https://github.com/martin-eden/FirmataAmbassador)
    (2023-06)

    Sort of "ambassador" to do useful things via dreadful Firmata protocol.

    Protocol parser/compiler. Reimplemented in a sane way. I threw my
    previous close-to-protocol implementation and switched focus to
    easy-to-understand interface.

  * [ArduinoLibGenerator](https://github.com/martin-eden/ArduinoLibGenerator)
    (2024-02 .. 2024-03)

    Tool to generate library description file for ArduinoIDE. Source
    data for library description is structured Lua table.

    Yo dawg i herd you dont like writing one-dimensional .ini files,
    not real programmers job?

* Embedded C++: Arduino(ATMega328P) and Esplora(ESP8266)

  Again three types of repos: codebase, completed, uncompleted.

  Codebase is infested with early sketches.

  * [Sketchbook](https://github.com/martin-eden/arduino_sketchbook)
    (2017-07 .. )

    Personal codebase for embedded C++ projects.

    My sketches/libraries for Arduino since start of my journey.

    I wish I can make it cleaner, but.. But like with my Lua [workshop]
    progress having higher priority than maintenance.

    Worthy part there in /libraries/me_...

  * Libraries

    * [me_Types](https://github.com/martin-eden/EmbeddedCpp_me_Types)
      (2024-02)

      Base types for other code.

    * [me_WifiShip](https://github.com/martin-eden/EmbeddedCpp_me_WifiShip)
      (2024-02)

      Esplora. Get/set MAC, scan, connect to router, get IP.

    * [me_Ws2812b](https://github.com/martin-eden/EmbeddedCpp-me_Ws2812b)
      (2024-03 .. 2024-05)

      AVR assembler. Write array at 800 kBits. Control RGB LED stripe.

      * [me_Ws2812b docs](https://github.com/martin-eden/EmbeddedCpp-me_Ws2812b-Docs)
        (2024-05)

        Additional docs for WS2812B LED stripe library.

  * [Willy](https://github.com/martin-eden/willy)
    (2023-12 .. )

    Two wheeled rover.

    Two decks, standoffs, battery, two DC motors, wheels, motor board,
    Arduino, Esplora, gyroscope (IMU6050).

    You can send commands to rover via Internet! (Well, at least in
    your local network). You will receive gyroscope readings as a
    feedback! You can teach this thingy to do tricks!

    Actually, it's good unannounced project. I was having fun
    designing [WifiShip] library, then [Ws2812b] implementation,
    then [SerialTokenizer]... Can't say when I will return to this.

    Anyway, not a bad place to read comments.

* Games

  World of Warcraft and Hearthstone-related side scripts.

  Currently I do not play these games (and Blizzard banned my several
  accounts). But the effort was spend so they are public archives.

  Stack is Lua, Bash (and parallel).

  * [Hearthstone cards renamer](https://github.com/martin-eden/hearthstone_cards_renamer)
    (2018-05)

    * [Hearthstone cards images](https://github.com/martin-eden/hearthstone_cards_named)
      (2018-04)

  * [Warcraft. Retrieve auction data for pets](https://github.com/martin-eden/pet_aux)
    (2016-06)

  * [Warcraft. Get general data about pets](https://github.com/martin-eden/pet_species_to_csv)
    (2016-06)

* Texts

  * [Tagging style](https://github.com/martin-eden/tagging_guideline)
    (2016-07)

    System of marking commit messages.

    Was written by me somewhere in 2016. But still interesting text to
    read if you wonder about syntax in my git commit messages.

  * [Firmata protocol](https://github.com/martin-eden/firmata_protocol/blob/main/protocol.md)
    (2021-08, 2023-05)

    Firmata protocol description. (Firmata protocol is related to Arduino world.)

    I've tried to describe protocol from my conspects and Lua implementations.
