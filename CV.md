## Who am I

I am human being writing under name "Martin Eden". (Nod to creation of
another human being who wrote under name "Jack London".)

## What I want

Something new. Interesting projects and interesting people.

I don't think it's possible to constructively define what is "interesting".
But lets start with this:

  * Data structures processing
  * Real-world projects

## What I do not want

At least this:

  * Maintenance of existing projects

## What I did

* University education ("Mathematician/System programmer")
* NEERC ACM ICPC contests (till 1/2 finals mostly) (2002 .. 2006)
* Work experience in Canada (2021 .. 2023)

Time flies!

* QBasic (QB also)

  * Projects

    * Text mode file viewer with hyperlinks to other files.
      Was inspired by "help" resident program interface. (MS-DOS times)
    * "UFO: Enemy Unknown" savegame editor. Graphical map of enemies.

* Pascal (Borland Pascal v7)

  * Algorithms/data structures: heaps, sorts, trees, hashmaps, text search.
  * Fun stuff: sudoku solver, nonogram solver, drawing strange attractors, cycloids,
    julias, turing machine, life, snake.
  * Projects
    * xTea encryption
    * ANSI text files display
    * Keyboard language changer (resident program)

* Delphi (Borland Delphi v7)

  * Lot of programming contest problems (dp, ad hoc)
  * Algorithms/data structures: heap, deque, trie, long arithmetic, solving system of linear equations
  * Fun stuff: quines, plasm, penrose mosaics, mine sweeper solver, markov chains
  * Projects
    * Cryptographic hashes: md2, md4, md5, sha1, haval. Plus crc's.
    * ElGamal encryption
    * BMP parser (get bitmap to send to LX-400 matrix printer)
    * Text tree menu (filer)
    * Zip format parser (results displayed in filer)
    * "World of Warcraft" character gear builder. Balanced search for sub-optimal sum of stats.

* PL/SQL (Oracle DB)

  Nothing interesting.

  * Function to collect billing, convert to pdf and email

* Lua (5.1 .. 5.3)

  * Some occasional interview/contest programs
  * Fun stuff: quines, mandel, linear plasm
  * Projects
    * Salsa20 encryption
    * "World of Warcraft" combat routines. Priority queue. Good design.
    * Zip format parser (again)
    * Lua code formatter

* C/C++ (ATMega328P, ESP8266, GNU AVR asm)

  * Fun stuff: ir relay, eca on led stripe, signal filtering, pids
  * Projects
    * PourManager (watering plants)
    * BlueTooth rover
    * WiFi rover
    * Thermo-hygrometer gadget
    * Ultrasonic ruler gadget

* C#

  Nothing notable really. Dreaded CI pipeline in organization.

  * Check function signature and report if bad. Reflection.
